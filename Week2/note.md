# 🧑‍💻 Fact Table Data Modeling Tutorial

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on **Fact Table Data Modeling**! This guide covers all the necessary concepts and explains the **8 tasks** related to designing, creating, and managing fact tables. 🚀

## 📚 Key Concepts: Fact and Dimension Tables

### 🗂 Dimension Tables
- **Definition:** Store descriptive attributes or dimensions that provide context to facts (e.g., product, customer, time).
- **Characteristics:**
  - Contain textual data or IDs.
  - Help in slicing and dicing fact table data.
  - May track changes over time using Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).

### 📊 Fact Tables
- **Definition:** Central tables in data models storing quantitative data (measures) related to business processes.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Contain foreign keys referencing dimension tables.
  - Store measures like counts, sums, or averages.
  - Large in size due to detailed, granular data.

## 🏗️ Task-by-Task Explanation

### 📝 Task 1: Deduplicate `game_details`
- **Goal:** Eliminate duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- **Why Important?**
  - Prevents incorrect aggregations or analyses.
  - Maintains accuracy in reports.
- **How It Works:**
  - Identify duplicates by grouping key columns.
  - Retain only the first occurrence of each duplicate.

### 📋 Task 2: Create `user_devices_cumulated` Table
- **Goal:** Design a fact table to track user activity by browser type.
- **Key Design Elements:**
  - **`user_id`:** Unique identifier for users.
  - **`browser_type`:** Type of browser used.
  - **`device_activity_datelist`:** An array of active dates.
  - **`datelist_int`:** A bitmask representation of the active dates for efficient storage.

### 🔢 Task 3: Generate `device_activity_datelist` and `datelist_int`
- **Goal:** Populate `device_activity_datelist` and compute `datelist_int` for each user and browser type.
- **Concepts Applied:**
  - Aggregate active dates for each user and browser.
  - Use a bitmask (`datelist_int`) to represent dates compactly.
  - Efficiently update or insert records into the table.

### 🔄 Task 4: Recalculate `datelist_int` from `device_activity_datelist`
- **Goal:** Ensure `datelist_int` accurately reflects `device_activity_datelist`.
- **Key Idea:** Transform date arrays into integer bitmasks.
- **Why Important?**
  - Maintains consistency between fields in the table.
  - Facilitates querying and analytics using the bitmask.

### 🌐 Task 5: Create `hosts_cumulated` Table
- **Goal:** Design a fact table to track host activity over time.
- **Table Design:**
  - **`host`:** The host/domain name.
  - **`host_activity_datelist`:** An array of dates when the host was active.
- **Purpose:**
  - Monitor and analyze host activity patterns.
  - Provide a summary view of host usage.

### 📅 Task 6: Incrementally Update `host_activity_datelist`
- **Goal:** Load new activity data into `hosts_cumulated` incrementally.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Extract and aggregate new activity data daily.
  - Merge new dates with existing ones while avoiding duplicates.
  - Perform **upserts** to maintain the latest state.

### 📈 Task 7: Create `host_activity_reduced` Table
- **Goal:** Summarize host activity at a monthly level for reporting.
- **Table Design:**
  - **`month`:** The first day of the month.
  - **`host`:** The host/domain name.
  - **`hit_array`:** Daily counts of hits (visits) as an array.
  - **`unique_visitors_array`:** Daily counts of unique visitors as an array.
- **Purpose:**
  - Improve query performance by pre-aggregating data.
  - Enable quick retrieval of monthly statistics.

### 🔁 Task 8: Incrementally Load `host_activity_reduced`
- **Goal:** Update the `host_activity_reduced` table day by day.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Process daily statistics: hits and unique visitors.
  - Append or update arrays to reflect daily changes.
  - Ensure arrays are accurate for all days in the month.
- **Why Incremental Loading?**
  - Avoids reprocessing the entire dataset.
  - Keeps data warehouse up to date efficiently.

## 🤔 Connecting the Tasks

1. **Start with Raw Data:**
   - Begin with detailed data in source tables (`events`, `devices`, etc.).

2. **Clean and Deduplicate Data:**
   - Ensure data quality by removing duplicates and standardizing formats.

3. **Aggregate and Transform:**
   - Summarize data at the required granularity (e.g., daily, monthly).
   - Use arrays and bitmasks for compact storage of time series data.

4. **Design Fact Tables for Queries:**
   - Store pre-aggregated data for faster querying and reporting.

5. **Load Incrementally:**
   - Process only new data to keep tables up to date without overloading the system.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Fact Tables:** Central to storing measures in a data warehouse.
- **Dimension Tables:** Provide context for analyzing facts.
- **Data Quality:** Deduplication and consistency checks are critical.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Use arrays and bitmasks for compact, efficient storage.
  - Pre-aggregate data to improve query speed.
- **Incremental Loading:** Ensures timely updates without reprocessing large datasets.

## 💡 Next Steps

- **Practice Data Modeling:**
  - Design your own fact and dimension tables for different scenarios.
- **Explore Advanced Concepts:**
  - Learn about Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) and star schema design.
- **Automate ETL Processes:**
  - Use tools like Apache Airflow or SQL scripts to schedule regular updates.
- **Enhance SQL Skills:**
  - Experiment with advanced SQL techniques like window functions, CTEs, and array manipulation.
